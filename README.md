# Convertor
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/833wiTPEjfs>
#### Description:

The project is an app that converts between different units of measurement. Like meters to centimeters.

It converts across many different systems of measurements like length, time, data, power, energy  and time more of which will be talked about later.

It was made using python and the customtkinter library for the G.U.I.

Technologies used:

- Python
- python os library
- customtkinter library
- sqlite3

## How the app works?

You choose the units you want tto convert from and the units you want to convert into and the app does convertion.

It takes unit to convert from for example if it is centimetres or feet and converts them into a standard like meters for length seconds for time, then uses the convertion rate from and to the unitnto convert to then does convertion.

### Theme

The app has a very limited range of themes:-

- Dark
- light

And a very limited color theme:-

- Blue
- Dark blue
- Green
- Pink

More might be added later.

### Database

The database stores the last theme that the user applied using sqlite3 so it can be loaded when the app starts a new.

## Possible improvements

As all applications this one can also be improved. Possible improvements:

- Functionality to change the number of decimal places the answer should have.
- More themes.
- More theme color
- Custom color theme
- The ability to perform calculations in the input field.
- Convertion to ta library so that it can be intergrated to other people's code.
- add convertions fo units of light

## How to launch application

1. Install the python in your PC.
2. Clone the code: https://github.com/om0g1/convertor
3. Install the customtkinter library.
4. You are ready to go!

## How to use
1. Run the code
2. Write the amount of the unit in the input field on the left.
3. Choose the unit you are converting from on the right dropdown menu
4. Choose the unit you are converting ti on the right dropdown
5. The convertion will be shown at the bottom whenever you type into the input or change the untis of convertion.
